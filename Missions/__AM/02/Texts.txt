// Dialogue 1 (after start of mission, hidden in forest)
$ D1-Sol1-1
- 	How the hell did our ancestors get this tooled up? They got better weapons than we have.
$ D1-JMM-1
- 	They must be from the future same as us.
$ D1-FSol2-1
- 	Like everyone just happens to have their personal time machine these days!?
$ D1-JMM-2
- 	I don't know how they got here, but they know about us. If the Russians knew what was going on they'd want to try and stop us.
$ D1-Sol3-2
- 	They're doing pretty well from what I've seen. I passed a couple of bodies on the way.
$ D1-Lisa-2
- 	We lost Phil Carpenter. I tried to save him but....
$ D1-JMM-3
- 	It's like a turkey shoot. They just sit here waiting for us to appear. Then mow us down.
$ D1-Sol3-3
- 	I don't get it, say the Russians found out, went and broke out the EON, how come they got here before us?
$ D1-Lisa-3
- 	Hey, our guys couldn't tell us what decade we'd hit or who'd get here first, maybe the Russians just got lucky.
$ D1-JMM-4
- 	Shut up. There is some incoming broadcast...
$ D1-Pow-4
- 	(weak signal over radio) Macmillan this is Colonel Powell at Alpha Base. Listen up! The enemy are based seven miles North of you and Alpha is beyond them.
$ D1-Cyrus-4
- 	[present] So what the fuck do we do!?
$ D1-Lisa-4
- 	[reply] Shut up and you might find out.
$ D1-Pow-5
- 	(continues) Contact all other survivors. Reconnoitre the area. Try to capture an outlying Russian building, consolidate your position and await further orders.
$ D1-Cyrus-5
- 	[present: alt a1] Fuck this, two millions years in past, surrounded by pissed Russians, the last I need is some fucking clown telling me to capture their building and stay put.
$ D1-Bobby-5
- 	[present: alt a2] What? We kill their guys then sit and wait for their friends to come looking!? Why not put a bullet in our brains right now.
$ D1-Lisa-5
- 	[reply] Cos knowing you, you'd probably miss!
$ D1-Bobby-6
- 	[reply] Fuck you.
$ D1-JMM-6
- 	Come on. You heard the Colonel. He gave an order. Let's do what the man says.

Engineers
Take a good look at people at your disposal (you can browse through them by pressing Tab or you can click Review Team icon on toolbar). Two of them are not dressed like soldiers, but like engineers instead. The profession kin gives characters the possibilities they otherwise would not have.

Soldiers' weapons have longer range and do greater damage. Also, soldiers can crawl.

Engineers can capture enemy buildings. They can also transport material and construct buildings (but you would have to capture some Russian base).

You will meet more professions later. The character's profession can be switched in specialised buildings.

[reviewing team] [classes]
!

! Groups
Groups
Watch your engineers carefully. If you lose them you will not be able to capture Russian depots.

If you want to select all engineers quickly (e.g. in order to send them out of combat), double-click any of them. By the same token, double-clicking a soldier selects all soldiers on map.

To streamline units handling you can create numbered groups. Select several characters and press e.g.. Ctrl+1. If you then press 1, this group will be re-selected. You can create e.g. a group of soldiers (number 1) and group of engineers (2) and group of all characters (3).

// Dialogue X1 (when Americans attack northern base first)
$ DX1-JMM-1
- 	Retreat. There's no way we're getting through Here without a lot more firepower.

! Hold
Hold command
If combat ensues, everybody tries to help anybody else. This also means that especially engineers, with their shorter range of fire, get into the harm's way. 

If you want to stop some of your characters from interfering in combat by their own volition, give them the order to stay put - select them and click Hold position icon (or press H). They will not leave their position now and they will only open fire at those enemy units that come within range.

// Dialogue X2 (when Americans capture eastern base)
$ DX2-Bobby-1
- 	[present - alt a1] Weird vehicles man. Ain't seen nothing like that before.
$ DX2-JMM-1
- 	[otherwise - alt a2] These vehicles surely look weird.
$ DX2-JMM-1a
- 	[$dialogue X1 executed] Check them out Bobby, they've gotta beat walking our way through the frontline. 

! CapturingVehicles1
Capturing vehicles
You managed to do away with vehicle crew before they managed to get in. This is your chance to steal vehicle. Select one of your men and right-click the empty vehicle. The character will get in and the vehicle's colour will change to the colour of your side.

[Capturing vehicles]
!

! CapturingVehicles2
Capturing vehicles
You captured Russian vehicles. The one that burns is lost - you would need an experienced mechanic to repair them. But the other one is operational - you can capture it. Select one of your men and right-click the empty vehicle. The character will get in and the vehicle's colour will change to the colour of your side.

[Capturing vehicles]
!

! ControlingVehicles
Controlling vehicles
You can control a vehicle in the same way you control your men - you can select it, group it, issue it default order by right-clicking (move or attack, depending on what you click) or give orders by clicking icons on command pane.

You can get out of vehicle by clicking Exit Vehicle icon (or by pressing E). You can enter it again by selecting a character and right-clicking the empty vehicle.

Please note, that there is one more bar above a vehicle. It shows how much fuel it has in its tank. Both movement and combat consume fuel. You have not much fuel and when it runs out, vehicle will stop. Therefore, you should be very careful about your fuel - there will be no possibility to refuel in this mission.

!

! CapturingBuilding
Capturing buildings
Your task is to capture Russian depots, those tall wooden buildings. Select one of your engineers and right-click an enemy depot. The engineer will get there and after a short while the depot will change colour to that of your side.

Capturing a depot is a very important action: it puts you into control of its supply of material and enables you to capture other buildings in the base.

 [Capturing buildings]
!

! Depot
Depot and base
You have captured enemy depot and thus gained a fledgling new base. If there is some other building nearby, you can capture it as well and join it to the base. You can change the profession of your men to engineers inside depot - you simply send one of them inside and then click Change to Engineer icon. Then click Exit building icon or right-click anywhere on the map and new engineer will leave the building.

In the upper right corner of the screen you can see a bar showing supplies of material, oil and siberite in depot. It also shows level of power supply and power consumption but we need not to concern us with them now.

[Depot] [Base]
!

! Building
If you have a depot with supply of material you can construct buildings within certain distance of it. In this mission, you can only build simple fortifications and an armoury. Select an engineer and click Build icon (or press B). Then choose a building you want to construct.

You will then see a shape of the selected building - move it around the map until you find a place where you want to place it. Use right mouse button to rotate the building (please note that it has entrances and so its rotation is of some importance: you wouldn't like to place a breastwork with the entrance pointed in the supposed direction of the enemy attack). Use the left mouse button to confirm building.

If the mock building turns red, you cannot build it on that place (probably because it is too far from depot or because the terrain is too uneven here).

[Construction of buildings]
!

! Armoury
Armoury
This is your first armoury. You can turn your people into soldiers there. Send them in by right-clicking the building and then click Change to soldier icon. Then right-click anywhere outside building (or click Exit Building icon) and your new soldiers will get out.

The armoury is built in such a way that it can be protected. Contrary to depot, the characters inside can shoot outside and so armoury can serve as a kind of fortification as well.

[Armoury]
!

! Breastworks
Breastwork
You have first breastwork. You can send one soldier inside - he will be able to shoot at the enemy while safe against fire.

Do you remember notes about terrain and line of sight? It is important to build breastworks on hills to increase its range of fire, because they can't move closer to enemy.

[Breastworks]
!

! Transporting
Resource pools and transportation
You have two depots in this moment and so you have two bases. Each base hase separate supplies of raw materials. You have a separate resource bar in the upper right corner of the screen for each of them. If you select a building, the resource bar of the corresponding base will light up.

As you can see, there is plenty of material in the eastern base. Your orders are to transport it to the northern base. You can go about it in the following way: select the eastern depot, click the Transport icon and click crates. Then click the northern base. This will issue command to transport maerial.

Now select an engineer and right-click a depot. Engineer will start carrying crates from one base to the other.
